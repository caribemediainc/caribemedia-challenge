## Deliverables

1. Use **REST** to build the API
2. **Language**: Typescript.
3. **Backend Framework**: Choose one - Nest.js (desirable), Express.js, or Fastify.
4. **Database**: Any, with a preference for Postgres or NoSQL CosmosDB.
5. **Cloud Deployment**: Azure preferred. Provide access to a working API instance.
6. **CI/CD**: Setup a continuous integration server for tests and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions).

## Nice to have (not required)

1. **Search Engine Integration**: Elastic Search or Azure Cognitive Search.
2. **Serverless Functions**: Utilize Azure Functions.
3. **GitHub Actions**: For Dockerization and deployment.
4. **Containerization and Orchestration**: Dockerize your application and prepare it for Kubernetes deployment.

**Note:** Ensure your code is efficient, readable, and well-documented. Good luck.
